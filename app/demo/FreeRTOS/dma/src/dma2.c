/*****************************************************************************************************************************************
 * HEAP: Heap4:
 * 1. Like heap_1 and heap_2, heap_4 works by subdividing an array into smaller blocks. As before, the array is statically declared, 
 *    and dimensioned by configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE, so will make the application appear to consume a lot of RAM, even before any memory has 
 *    actually been allocated from the array
 * 2. Heap_4 uses a first fit algorithm to allocate memory. Unlike heap_2, heap_4 combines (coalescences) adjacent free blocks of 
 *    memory into a single larger block, which minimizes the risk of memory fragmentation
 * 3. The first fit algorithm ensures pvPortMalloc() uses the first free block of memory that is large enough to hold the number of 
 *    bytes requested. For example, consider the scenario where:
 *    1.  The heap contains three blocks of free memory that, in the order in which they appear in the array, are 5 bytes, 200 bytes, 
 *        and 100 bytes, respectively.
 *    2. pvPortMalloc() is called to request 20 bytes of RAM
 *    3. The first free block of RAM into which the requested number of bytes will fit is the 200-byte block, so pvPortMalloc() splits 
 *       the 200-byte block into one block of 20 bytes, and one block of 180 bytes1, before returning a pointer to the 20-byte block. 
 *       The new 180-byte block remains available to future calls to pvPortMalloc().
 * 4. Heap_4 combines (coalescences) adjacent free blocks into a single larger block, minimizing the risk of fragmentation, and making 
 *    it suitable for applications that repeatedly allocate and free different sized blocks of RAM.
 * 
 * Refer Heap4 image for example, Notes is not covered since we understand by the image.
 * 
 * Heap_4 is not deterministic, but is faster than most standard library implementations of malloc() and free().
 * 
 * Setting a Start Address for the Array Used By Heap_4:
 * 1. Sometimes it is necessary for an application writer to place the array used by heap_4 at a specific memory address. For example, the stack used by a FreeRTOS task is allocated from 
 *    the heap, so it might be necessary to ensure the heap is located in fast internal memory, rather than slow external memory.
 * 2. By default, the array used by heap_4 is declared inside the heap_4.c source file, and its startaddress is set automatically 
 *    by the linker.
 * 3. However, if the configAPPLICATION_ALLOCATED_HEAP compile time configuration constant is set to 1 in  FreeRTOSConfig.h, 
 *    then the array must instead be declared by the application that is using  FreeRTOS. If the array is declared as part of the 
 *    application, then the application’s writer can set its start address.
 * 4. If configAPPLICATION_ALLOCATED_HEAP is set to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h, then a uint8_t array called ucHeap, and dimensioned by the 
 *    configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE setting, must be declared in one of the application’s source files.
 * 
 * The syntax required to place a variable at a specific memory address is dependent on the compiler in use, so refer to your 
 * compiler’s documentation.
 * 
 * Example:
 * uint8_t ucHeap[ configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE ] __attribute__ ( ( section( ".my_heap" ) ) ); for GCC compiler
 * 
 * HEAP: Heap5:
 * 1. The algorithm used by heap_5 to allocate and free memory is identical to that used by heap_4. Unlike heap_4, heap_5 is not 
 *    limited to allocating memory from a single statically declared  array; heap_5 can allocate memory from multiple and separated 
 *    memory spaces.
 * 2. Heap5 is useful when the RAM provided by the system on which FreeRTOS is running does not appear as a single contiguous 
 *    (without space) block in the system’s memory map.
 * 3. At the time of writing, heap_5 is the only provided memory allocation scheme that must be explicitly initialized before 
 *    pvPortMalloc() can be called. Heap_5 is initialized using the vPortDefineHeapRegions() API function.
 * 4. When heap_5 is used, vPortDefineHeapRegions() must be called before any kernel objects (tasks, queues, semaphores, etc.) 
 *    can be created.  
 * 
 * vPortDefineHeapRegions() API arguments and usage is expalained in the program above.
 * 
 * 1. When a project is built, the linking phase of the build process allocates a RAM address to each variable. The RAM available for 
 *    use by the linker is normally described by a linker configuration file, such as a linker script
 * 2. In Heap5 image - B side -  it is assumed the linker script included information on RAM1, but did not include information on RAM2 
 *    or RAM3. The linker has therefore placed variables in RAM1, leaving only the portion of RAM1
 * 3. The linker has left all of RAM2 and all of RAM3 unused, leaving the whole of RAM2 and the whole of RAM3 available for use by 
 *    heap_5
 * 4. The address used by Heap5 and to hold variables may overlap and may face below issue. while selecting start address for Heap5
 *    we may encounter below issue.
 *    1. The start address might not be easy to determine.
 *    2. The amount of RAM used by the linker might change in future builds, necessitating an update to the start address used in the 
 *       HeapRegion_t structure.
 *    3. The build tools will not know, and therefore cannot warn the application writer, if the RAM used by the linker and the RAM 
 *       used by heap_5 overlap.
 * 5. Example2 demonstrates a more convenient and maintainable example. It declares an array called ucHeap. ucHeap is a normal variable,
 *    so it becomes part of the data allocated to RAM1 by the linker.
 * 
 * Advantages of Example2:
 * 1. It is not necessary to use a hard coded start address.
 * 2. The address used in the HeapRegion_t structure will be set automatically, by the linker, so will always be correct, even if the 
 *    amount of RAM used by the linker changes in future builds.
 * 3. It is not possible for RAM allocated to heap_5 to overlap data placed into RAM1 by the linker.
 * 4. The application will not link if ucHeap is too big.
 * 
 * Heap Related Utility Function:
 * 1. Explained in HeapHelpAPI function above.
 * 
 * Malloc Failed Hook Functions:
 * 1. All the example heap allocation schemes can be configured to call a hook (or callback) function if a call to pvPortMalloc() 
 *    returns NULL.
 * 2. If configUSE_MALLOC_FAILED_HOOK is set to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h, then the application must provide a malloc failed hook function
 *    that has the name and prototype shown below
 * 
 * void vApplicationMallocFailedHook( void );
